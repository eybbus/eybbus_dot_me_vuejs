    <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I originate from the valley of Skíðadalur. I went to junior college VMA to learn to
      be an Electrical Technician. Finished my Icelandic matriculation examination there and moved to
      Reykjavík to finish my Apprenticeship and graduated as a journeyman Electrical Technician.
      Currently, I'm finishing Computer science at the University of Reykjavík.
      <br>
      <br>I have always been very interested in tech, which is a big part of the reason for going into Electrical Technician.
      There I got my first taste of programming and liked it. I also started to learn web programming at home and decide to go to University to learn it better and choose
      The University of Reykjavík because they focus a lot on working with other people.
      <br>
      <br>I'm always open minded to learn and do new things, can't remember when the last time I got angry and am a calm person overall.
      I may some times be too hard on myself and I'm bad about suggesting things to do with my friends.
      <br>
      <br>Lastly some of my friends call me Eybbus. Hence the name of my website and its also quite often my screen name.
